# Algebra applications

This repository contains four applications of linear algebra and matrices. Tha aim is to show the power and versatility of basic properties of matrices combined with scientific software. We explain below how to run the different files

## Supervised learning
In this example we construct from scratch, and without using calculus, a training algorythm for image recognition aplpiead to the MNIST set. At the end this is comapered with the same model built on TensorFlow.

### How to run
Simply click this binder link and navigate to the notebook file.

## Encryption
In this example we use the theory of invertibility of elementary matrices to construct an encryption algorythm. You can input a password to encrypt a message and then decrypt the message using the same password.
