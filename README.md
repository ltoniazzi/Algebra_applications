# Algebra applications

This repository contains four tutorials illustrating applications of linear algebra and matrices. Tha aim is to show the power and versatility of basic properties of matrices combined with scientific software. The first three notebooks can be accessed by simply cliking [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ltoniazzi/Algebra_applications/main) and then navigating to the desired `.ipynb` file. See below for more details. Enjoy!

## Supervised learning

In this tutorial we construct from scratch, and without using calculus, a training algorythm for image recognition applied to the MNIST set. At the end this is comapered with the same model trained with TensorFlow.

## Encryption

In this tutorial we use the theory of invertibility of elementary matrices to construct an encryption algorythm. You can input a password to encrypt a message and then decrypt the message using the same password.

## Population dynamics

In this tutorial we construct a two dymensional dynamical system of Markovian type, which describes the way two populations move between two locations. You can change the dynamics/matrix to anything you want.

## Virtual reality
In this tutorial we construct two 3-dimensional games, where we use vector addition and matrix multiplication to control our avatar and reach a target.
